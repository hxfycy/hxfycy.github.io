title: 'My internship at NJ'
---

I had a wonderful time at Rutgers, NJ, US. Thanks to Prof.Bo Yuan's generous guidance and patience, I finished a three-month internship at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Rutgers and submitted one paper to IEEE-ICASSP-2020 <a href="https://github.com/hxfycy/TuckerDecomposition/blob/master/mat/ICASSP_Submitted_Paper.pdf">(Paper url)</a>. I want to sincerely thank all of people I met during the trip at Rutgers, they're so wonderful and it's they who make this trip so unique and meaningful.
