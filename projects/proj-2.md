title: 'My internship at NJ'
---

I had a wonderful time at Rutgers, NJ, US. So grateful to Prof.Bo Yuan's generous guidance and patience, I finished a three-month internship at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Rutgers and submitted one paper to IEEE-ICASSP-2020 <a href="https://github.com/hxfycy/TuckerDecomposition/blob/master/mat/ICASSP_Submitted_Paper.pdf">(Paper url)</a>. 
I want to give my sincere thank to all the people I met during my internship, it's this group of wonderful people who make this trip so unique and meaningful.
